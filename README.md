# Flott - Motion Control in Rust

## About

**Developing motion control software in Rust should be easy!** Flott aims to make this a reality, by providing libraries that abstract over hardware commonly used for motion control, like motors, encoders, and other sensors and actuators.

Please [check out the website][flott-motion.org] and the [organization page on GitHub][Flott] for more information.

This repository is intended for project-wide discussion and documentation of project-wide policies.
